<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, I’m <strong>Juan-Elmo Heldsinger</strong>, and I’m just getting started on my journey as a web developer. I’ve always been fascinated by technology, and I’m diving headfirst into the world of coding, designing, and building things that people can actually use.

  Right now, I’m focused on HTML and creating websites that look good and work even better. This is my first portfolio, but I’ve worked on personal projects like my own private website. It’s been a hands-on learning experience, and I’m excited to see where it takes me.
  
  What I love most is turning ideas into reality. Seeing something go from a concept to an actual, working design is what keeps me going. I want to build websites that are not just functional but visually appealing—something people genuinely enjoy using.
  
  Outside of coding, I’m also exploring ethical hacking because I’m curious about how things work behind the scenes. I’m hardworking, always open to learning, and determined to push myself to deliver more than what’s expected.
  
  This portfolio is just the beginning, and I’m looking forward to growing, creating, and maybe even working on your next project</p>
